MIC - Mic the Image Creator
===========================

Overview
--------
MIC means "Mic the Image Creator" and it's used to create images for Tizen.
The tool offers three major functions:

- image creation
- image conversion bwtween two different formats
- chrooting into an image 

With the MIC tool, users can create different types of images for different
verticals, including live CD images, live USB images, raw images for KVM,
loop images for IVI platforms, and fs images for chrooting. Also, users can
work in a chroot environment, based on an existing live image using MIC's
enhanced chrooting. Besides, MIC enables transforming an image to another
image format, a very useful function for those sensitive to image format.

It can also provide plugin mechanism for developers to expand image type or
image options, and even to hook.
